# lib-database

**lib-database** is a generic library for accessing sql databases on the JVM. It was developed for being used with the
[Bukkit](https://spigot.org) platform and [libmanager](https://github.com/MCCityVille/libmanager) plugin. It is
inspired by [Spring framework](https://spring.io/) and utilizes [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava). The
reference implementation uses [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) as a connection pool.
